## Current State

The `dendi/php-version` branch exists locally and is ready to use. It cannot be pushed to the remote repository from this environment due to authentication constraints, but the helper script `push-php-version-branch.sh` is provided to facilitate this when run with appropriate credentials.

## How to Push the Branch

Run the following command with appropriate Git credentials:
```bash
./push-php-version-branch.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
git push -u origin dendi/php-version
```

## Verification Commands

To verify the branch exists:
```bash
git branch -a | grep dendi/php-version
```

To verify it's based on main:
```bash
git log dendi/php-version --oneline -3
```
